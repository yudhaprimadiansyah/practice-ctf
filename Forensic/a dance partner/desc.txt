Animesh and Ayushi are good friends. Ayushi is good at dancing but Animesh is not. As Felicity is coming, Animesh, keeping his hacking skills aside, is trying to learn a Bollywood dance from Ayushi. As Ayushi knows that Animesh is not good at dancing, she teaches him only easy moves, such as moving forward, backward, right and left. Animesh, after lot of practise is now able dance well with those limited moves, but unfortunately he is unable to get any partner. Animesh asks his friend Aalekh for help, but instead of helping, Aalekh, based on Animesh's dance performance gave him a Jumbo Maze Puzzle hidden with a flag (sign of true friendship :P). Aalekh promises him that if he can extract the flag out of the Maze, he will get a partner for Animesh. As you all would have known Animesh very well till now, he want a dance partner at any cost, hence he asks you for the help to find the flag. Can you help Animesh find his dance partner?
